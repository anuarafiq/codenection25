'Fix The Docs', an automation for documentation in real world tech industry.
We have chosen the Industry Collaboration Track: 
In real-world tech environments, documentation is a critical but broken part of the software development lifecycle.
Writing it is slow, repetitive, and often skipped.
Reading it is painful and time-consuming, especially for new joiners.
Maintaining it is impractical in fast-changing systems — documentation quickly becomes outdated, misleading, or irrelevant.
This leads to onboarding delays, wasted engineering time, and avoidable bugs — all due to poor or outdated docs.
